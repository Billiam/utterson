# Directory /sites

In this directory you will find the Jekyll websites that Mister Hyde has access to.

To create a new website, there is a couple of different options:

 * Use Mister Hyde to create new Jekyll websites
 * Create new websites manually with `jekyll new`: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/
 * Or symlink to Jekyll websites elsewhere in the filesystem.
